# A History of Rome in Maps

## Project Purpose and my Goal
The purpose of this project was to use the knowledge that I learn so far to build a simple web application. This project was a test of my abilities to think critically and put together the sum of what I've learned in Phase 1 of my journey with Flatiron. As my first project from scratch, the challenge was more than I expected. With that in mind, I learned a lot about HTML and CSS as well as Javascript that I wouldn't have without hands on trial and error. This project exposed my weaknesses as well as my strengths and showed me what I needed to work on.

My goal with this project was to build a simple web application that I could be proud of. I took some things that I enjoy immensely, history and maps, and using my favorite time period I build a web application that, despite it's simplicity, I am proud of. I greatly enjoy talking about history and geography, and I wanted to share my passion with others through this web application
